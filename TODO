* on-change
    [✓] Implement OnChange<T> wrapper struct w/state and dirty flag

* antigen-winit
    [✓] Investigate storing window handle inside component
        Currently no way to query or modify from the game thread
        Send + Sync with no mut methods - can use Arc<Window>
    [✓] Refactor based on window handle living inside component
        May allow for structural improvements
    [✓] Implement component-cached on-change systems for window properties
        Use components to represent window properties, operate on handle via systems
        Should refactor the Name handling into a WindowTitle component
        Some properties (ex. fullscreen) will allow state to be read directly
    [✓] Refactor always redraw logic as a redraw mode component

* antigen-wgpu
    [✓] Refactor to use cube renderer approach
        Currently trying to store pass-private data generally (bind groups, pipelines)
        Instead, client code should own it
        Remove pipelines and bind groups from WgpuManager storage
        Reimplement cube, triangle renderers as structs w/Renderer trait
        Expose buffer IDs in state struct so ECS can modify via request
    [✓] Create lazy-loading abstraction to ease renderer implementation
    [✓] Pass surface config instead of format to reduce entity id passing
    [✓] Investigate storing surface config as thread-safe reference instead of clone
        Better to have a single source of truth, but is likely to complicate threading
    [✓] Factor buffer storage out of WgpuManager
        Cube renderer proves this isn't needed
        More in-line with recommended middleware pattern
    [✓] Refactor example renderers following structural changes
    [✓] Organise crate
    [✓] Setup data pipeline for mesh instancing
        Existing renderers take a one-buffer-per-entity approach
        Not ideal, as data upload and draw calls are a bottleneck
    [✓] Setup data pipeline for multiple meshes
        Upload all meshes in one set of buffers
        Call draw_indexed_indirect once per mesh w/indirect offset
    [✓] Setup data pipeline for mesh loading / generation / GPU upload
    [✓] Setup data pipeline for texture loading / generation / GPU upload
        [✓] Image type and component for CPU-side texture data
        [✓] Texture component for game thread data uploads
        [✓] OnChange caching for texture data upload
        [✓] Improve TextureData impl
            Need to see if it can be auto-implemented based on a deref-ed / OnChange-wrapped value
        [ ] Size / format-based lazy allocation / reallocation?
            Seems perhaps a bit too frameworky - renderer should probably dictate format
            Wait and see how the use case shapes up
    [ ] Refactor renderers to use middleware pattern
        Return command buffers for submission by calling code
        Check wgpu wiki to refresh on specifics
    [ ] Setup instance control
        Used fixed-size buffer allocation
            Known number of instances and indirect draw calls
        Hand out indices from renderer
            One set of indices per mesh
            Use RAII to reclaim indices when components are dropped
                Will require storing a shared reference to the renderer's storage in the index type 
            Return error if trying to allocate beyond instance limit for a given mesh
                More useful than a panic for debugging overrun,
                can measure excess instead of halting immediately
        Use compute shader to generate indirect buffer
            At a basic level, this means writing visible instances as draw calls
                Specfically for dynamic instances that may change visibility
                Use frustum culling / visibility flag as a predicate
                Naive implementation can write one draw call per instance
                Potential for packing instances into ranges to reduce total draw calls
            More advanced uses can account for special-case instancing
                Indirect buffer can be partitioned into per-behavior ranges
                    ex. First n bytes is sector draws, remainder is dynamic objects
                    Can this reservation be done in a generic manner?
                        Could include a range with buffer handles distributed from renderer
                        Would be useful to leverage the ECS for highly modular rendering
                Sector rendering
                    Pack linearly-connected sectors together into single meshes
                        Use vertex offset to display a subset
                        Visible range will always be linear
                            Viewpoint starts in a sector and extends back / forward within buffer
                    Update offsets by writing range start / end indices directly into indirect buffer
                
    [ ] Support decoupled physics interpolation
        [ ] Camera
        [ ] Instances
    [ ] Support shared renderer state
        i.e. being able to render multiple per-surface perspectives with one RenderPassComponent
    [ ] Refactor existing code to use OnChange pattern
        [✓] Matrices
        [ ] Surface config?
        [ ] Aspect ratio
        etc
    [ ] Support staging belt for data uploads
        Need to recall after the encoder is submitted
        Requires async spawn or device.poll()
        Separate codepath for renderers that need control over the encoder?
            Redraw mode enum in window component?
                Always redraw / shared encoder
                Always redraw / own encoder
                Always redraw / request? (Call request_redraw at end of MainEventsCleared)
                Redraw on request

* antigen-hid
    [ ] Integrate with sandbox
    [ ] Solidify API

* TUI Debugger
    [>] Develop generalized widget system based around reflection data model
        * Parent-child nesting naturally forms a tree; no need to create a monolithic tree control
        * Instead, compose from component parts and scroll wrappers
        * Provide a default set of widgets to match the data model
        * Extend via overrides based on some predicate
    
* Tracing Debugger
    [ ] Integrate new channel-based tracing backend

* Legion Debugger
    [ ] Tidy archetype, entity and resource code following widget refactor

    [✓] Trait setup for legion debugger
        * Goal: Generalize debugging of legion's serialized world formats
        * Should be able to create TUI, EGUI, Dear ImGui variants with equivalent functionality
        [✓] Parse reflection data model into archetype / entity -specific IR
        [✓] Implement ArchetypeDebugger and EntityDebugger traits

    [✓] Resource support
        * Legion provides no serialization support for resources
        * Will need to enforce a Serialize constraint for debugging
        [✓] Setup resource debugging registry
        [✓] Implement manual fetch-and-serialize for display using the same approach as World

    [>] Schedule support
        * Legion provides no serialization support for schedules
        * Will need to use tracing scope around schedule call to extract data
        * Pass to debugger as optional param
        * Probably best to avoid converting to IR with serde, since the trace tree is already IR

    [>] TUI
        [✓] Hierarchical input focus
            * Needs to support top-level tabs, nested tabs, focused lists
        [✓] Improve entity debugger
            [✓] Use a Table, parse rows directly from entity list
            [ ] Wrapping layout for components
                * Currently space-inefficient
        [✓] Unify styling
            * Pass in a pre-styled Table when parsing the world into a widget
            * Overwrite layout-specific borrow-only parameters when rendering inside widget
        [ ] Better support for multi-threaded tracing
            * Currently clears trace tree at start of game loop, parses at end
            * This misses out on events that happen while the game loop is asleep
                * Effectively limits visibility to a single-threaded view of multi-threaded state
            * Clearing after parse results in unintuitive output
                * Technically correct as it captures everything, but frames start in the middle and overlap
            * Need a better solution for grouping and displaying trace data
                * Likely based on callsites - group by module and target
                * Show thread invocations in callsite entries
                * Regardless, will have to improve capture
                    * Flush / parse trace tree per thread for proper starts / ends
                * Current model is still useful
                    * But more for freeze-frames that show exactly what occurred on a given thread on a given frame
                    * (Somewhat like the frame window in Godot's profiler)
        [>] Improve styling
            * Make use of more colors
            * Different colors per tabline, per component, etc?
            [✓] Need a separate color for non-active tabs
                * Currently collides with white title color
                * Use light variant of highlight color?
                * Alternately, use red
            [ ] Use info color for entity IDs, struct names
            [ ] Use a new color for struct field names
            [ ] Parse entity ID debug output for more control over display
                * Will need to panic or fallback if format is not as expected
            [ ] Figure out how to deal with Span and multi-line content
                * Use Text type - plugs into Paragraph / ListItem
        [ ] Generalize
            * Should be able to specify override widgets for data with a specific shape
            * This should range from top-level widgets like archetype / entity debuggers
            * to granular ones like primitive types, or compositions like Position { x: f32, y: f32 }
            * This should form the basis for editable widgets
                * Which in turn forms the basis for deserialization
            [ ] Use Index and Path as the basis of a general widget system
            [ ] Use Index and Path as the basis of a general focus system
        [ ] Fix layout overflow

    [ ] Optimize
        * Currently serializes entire world every frame
        * This will scale very badly with larger worlds
        * Need to find a way to leverage queries and events
        * Reflection widgets will need a way to control world serialization queries
            * Will enable coarse culling of archetypes and entities
            * Can avoid querying completely if UI is in a state that doesn't need a given set of data
        [ ] Archetype Debugger
            [ ] Listen for archetype create / destroy events
            [ ] Maintain list of active archetypes, use to populate archetype list
            [ ] Use queries to serialize only the active archetype
            [ ] Serialize only a subset of entities from that archetype (repeater list pattern)
                * Can queries take a range of entities?
        [ ] Entity debugger
            [ ] Maintain a list of active entities, use to populate list
            [ ] Serialize only the active entity

* Reflection
    [✓] Automated debugger type registration
        [✓] Use linkme crate w/inventory-style macros for registration
        [✓] Add inventory support for platforms that can't use linkme
        [✓] Create linkme / inventory -specific procedural registration macros that only need one parameter
    [✓] Name API
        * Need a way to fetch the name of a type without reading its data
        * Give Data a name() method
        * Print literal names for primitive types, name fields for structs
    [✓] Index enum for fetching data from collections generically
    [✓] Path enum for recursively traversing a Data tree
    [ ] Investigate serialization issues with large Vec<u8> (256*256)
    [ ] Consider whether Path should have a unit variant to represent root / no-op
        * Probably helpful, as it aids composition
        * Allows for a Default implementation
        * Allows for more sensical is_empty() implementation
        * Allows for inline builder methods instead of needing a separate struct
        * Allows for matching the root element of a tree
            * Makes it possible to compose, say, a deeply-nested UI in a single struct
    [ ] Consider refactoring Path to be a newtype over Vec<Index> instead
        * Currently a manual linked-list implementation w/Box indirection
        * Not strongly typed (ex. IntegerIndex<StringIndex<DataIndex<()>>>), so not really necessary
        * Using Vec would allow it to be treated as a collection, use iterators, etc.
            * Opens up interesting possibilities like traversing path targets one-by-one
    [ ] Insertion support using Path
        * Should be able to add a new leaf to an existing Data tree using a path
    [ ] Data matching functionality using Index and Path
        * Specify a path to target data, use predicates to define the expected shape of the data
        * Supply supplementary data alongside this (such as a class-specific UI widget)
        * Return a reference to the data if it matches, false otherwise
            * Need Option support for Index and Path
        * Collect these predicates and associated data via plugin registry
    [ ] Deserialization support
        * Goal: Seamlessly deserializing edited entities into an existing world
        * Legion's UUID support should be able to handle collision (i.e. by overwriting)
        [ ] Implement Deserializer class

* Plugin Registry
    [✓] Create plugin-registry crate to wrap inventory and linkme
    [ ] Proc macro symbol cleanup
        * Currently not using camel-case for generated functions

* Antigen
    [ ] Port existing antigen functionality
        * Will need to consider refactoring around legion resources where appropriate
